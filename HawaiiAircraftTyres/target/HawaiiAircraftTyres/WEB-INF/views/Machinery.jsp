<p>Aircraft tires can easily be taken for granted. Their simplistic appearance may lead some to a false feeling of complacency. 
Many technicians are not aware of the critical design factors that go into every aircraft tire in use today. Seemingly minor flaws can lead to disastrous results, 
and inadequate maintenance practices can cause shortened tire life and even cause unsafe operating conditions.
When one considers the forces that aircraft tires endure, it seems amazing that engineers were ever able to develop these special products.
Some tires are subjected to speeds as fast as a race car while at the same time supporting more weight than the largest land moving machines. 
They go through cyclic exposure to varying temperatures and pressures. These factors make aircraft tire design a critical process and tire maintenance an ever important step in safe aircraft operation.</p>

<b style="font-size:20px;">Tire Design : </b></br></br>
Designing aircraft tires is a very intense undertaking. Once an aircraft manufacturer goes to the tire manufacturer with the size and weight requirements,
the tire manufacturer begins the process of designing a tire that meets the needs of the aircraft manufacturer as well as all regulatory requirements including foreign regulations in many cases.
Engineers are challenged with designing tires with cool running, heat-resistant materials while simultaneously exceeding tire service requirements.
Tire prototypes are put through rigorous tests that simulate cycles of landings, take-offs, and taxi operations. 
It is only after the tires pass all mandatory tests and meet the requirements of the aircraft manufacturer and air authorities that the tires are put into production.
Two types of tires are used in aircraft applications bias-ply tires and radial tires. Although both types of tires share some similarities in design, there are differences that need to be noted.
</br>
</br>
Bias-ply tires are popular choices for aircraft tires because of their durability and retreadability. The tire construction consists of the following components:</br>
<b>Tread:</b> The tread is made of rubber mixed with other additives to obtain the desired level of toughness, durability, and resistance to wear.
 The tread pattern is designed to aircraft operational requirements, with the ribbed tread design used widely due to its good traction under varying run way conditions.</br>
<b>Sidewall:</b> The sidewall is a protective layer of rubber that covers the outer casing ply. It extends from the tread edge to the bead area.</br>
<b>Tread Reinforcing Ply:</b> One or more layers of fabric that strengthens and stabilizes the tread area for high-speed operation. It also serves as a reference for the buffing process when tires are retreaded.</br>
<b>Buff Line Cushion:</b> The buff line cushion is made of rubber compound to enhance the adhesion between the tread reinforcing ply and the breakers or casing plies. It is of sufficient thickness to allow for the removal of the old tread when the tire is retreaded.</br>
<b>Breakers:</b> Breakers are reinforcing plies of rubber-coated fabric placed under the buff line cushion to protect casing plies and strengthen and stabilize the tread area. They are considered an integral part of the casing construction.</br>
<b>Casing Plies:</b> Alternate layers of rubber-coated fabric (running at opposite angles to one another) provide the strength of the tire.</br>
<b>Wire Beads:</b> Hoops of high tensile strength steel wire that anchor the casing plies and provide a firm mounting surface on the wheel. The outer edge of the bead that fits against the wheel flange is called the bead heel. The inner bead edge is called the bead toe.</br>
<b>Apex Strip:</b> A wedge of rubber affixed to the top of the bead bundle.</br>
<b>Flippers:</b> Layers of rubberized fabric that help anchor the bead wires to the casing and improve the durability of the tire.</br>
<b>Ply Turnups:</b> The casing plies are anchored by wrapping them around the wire beads, thus forming the ply turnups.</br>
<b>Chafer:</b> A protective layer of rubber and/or fabric located between the casing plies and wheel to minimize chafing.</br>
<b>Liner:</b> In tubeless tires, the liner is a layer of low permeability rubber that acts as a built-in tube and restricts gas from diffusing into the casing plies. In tube-type tires, a thinner liner is used to prevent tube chafing against the inside ply.</br>
